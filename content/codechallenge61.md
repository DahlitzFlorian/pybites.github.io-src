Hey Pythonistas,

##Changing the PCC game a bit

Let's be honest here: we slack off a bit on our blog code challenges! Apart from the increased workload overall, our _synchronous_ approach of solving a challenge before launching a next one, is holding us back.

So we are going to change our approach a bit. We keep launching PyBites Code Challenges (PCCs) on our blog, because most importantly this is what gets YOU to write Python code!

However we are dropping hard deadlines and review posts. Solving them is an ongoing thread and you can see merged solutions [on the community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community) (each challenge # has a dedicated folder).

You can collaborate with each other [on our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pybites/shared_invite/enQtNDAxODc0MjEyODM2LTNiZjljNTI2NGJiNWI0MTRkNjY4YzQ1ZWU4MmQzNWQyN2Q4ZTQzMTk0NzkyZTRmMThlNmQzYTk5Y2Y5ZDM4NDU) (#codechallenge channel). And of course keep PR'ing your code via [our platform](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/).

##Want to code review / become a mentor?

We are still getting a pretty manageable number of PRs to be able to merge them all in ourselves. However we think it would be really cool to give each PR a bit more of a code check. Hence we also want to make this a *community effort*.

So if you want to help out merging PRs into our challenges branch, [volunteer on our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pybites/shared_invite/enQtNDAxODc0MjEyODM2LTNiZjljNTI2NGJiNWI0MTRkNjY4YzQ1ZWU4MmQzNWQyN2Q4ZTQzMTk0NzkyZTRmMThlNmQzYTk5Y2Y5ZDM4NDU), we're looking for moderators.

It's a great chance to read other people's code, hone your code review skills, and last but not least, become a mentor building up great relationships with other Pythonistas. Sounds fair enough?

##OK and now ... Code Challenge time!

In this challenge we're asking you to spice up your life with your very own URL Shortener!

We've all seen sites like bit.ly that allow you to shorten a URL into something... well... shorter! It's time to you make your own.

There are roughly four parts to this challenge:

1. Make a small Django/Flask/Bottle app that receives in a URL.

2. Using the supplied URL, generate a unique URL with the base of "pybit.es". It should be generated keeping uniqueness in mind. 

3. Return the shortened URL.

4. **Bonus**: track the visits in a second DB table for stats.

It sounds more complex but breaking it down into these steps should help you tackle the problem more effectively.

Good luck and have fun!

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, open a GH Issue or reach out via Twitter, Slack or Email.

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
