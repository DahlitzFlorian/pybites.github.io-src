### Read Code for Fun and Profit

You can look at all submitted code [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and/or [on our Community branch](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community).

Here are the Pythonic learnings we spotted in Pull Requests made during the last week: 

#### [PCC03](http://codechalleng.es/challenges/03)

> Learned about difflib SequenceMatcher and collections Counter. - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/407)

#### [PCC04](http://codechalleng.es/challenges/04)

> I finally worked with an API in python, I found little more information about working of unittests, got to know little more about CSV module. - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/406)

#### [PCC16](http://codechalleng.es/challenges/16)

> learned about the IP address lookup API - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/415)

<!-- -->

> I learn how to make http request to remote database (in this project used RIPE DB) and how to parse JSON output from DB - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/414)

<!-- -->

> Learned how to use PRAW module to interact with Reddit API. Managed to get the top topic submissions per valid subreddit topic. - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/412)

#### [PCC26](http://codechalleng.es/challenges/26)

> I learned how to use PyQt5, python GUI framework. I managed to get familiar on views events, especially on click. Also, managed to play with PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets to load a webpage of a given URL - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/409)

#### [PCC54](http://codechalleng.es/challenges/54)

> Gained more experience representing datetime objects as strings in the format I want them, used error handling to make my code more concise, and found the useful string method splitlines() which gives a list of all strings separated by newlines. I can easily insert an element into the list and then reform the list into file contents. This is much easier than parsing through a string of all the file contents to find a certain location. - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/410)

#### [PCC57](http://codechalleng.es/challenges/57)

> Nice one to get back into Pandas, this helped: https://pybit.es/guest-marvel-data-analysis.html - still some work to be done like merging countries and more plotting, but moving on for now. - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/416)

<!-- -->

> Definitely. Learned that I still have a lot to learn about Pandas :) - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/413)

<!-- -->

> The Git was the most challenging part - but good practice! I got a little distracted trying to solve new problems. - [PR](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/pull/411)
