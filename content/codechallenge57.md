Hey Pythonistas, 

A new week, a new Python code challenge! 

This week you can use Python, Pandas and all the libraries you need to analyze the data of Olympic Games and find out interesting things and present them to everyone with Matpolib, Seaborn and/or Plotly.

## The Challenge

### Basic/ required

Analyse statistics of Olympic Games in a CSV file that you can find [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games). 

1. Find out the (male and female) athlete who won most medals in all the Summer Olympic Games (1896-2014). The answer will be Michael Phelps for the men and Larisa Latynina for the women.

2. Display the first 10 countries that won most medals:

	* The order for men will be: USA, RUS, GBR, GER, FRA, ITA, SWE, HUN, AUS, JPN

	* The order for women will be: USA, RUS, GER, CHN, AUS, NED, ROU, GBR, JPN, HUN

3. Use `matplotlib` to build line plots of the 10 most awarded countries for time span 1896-2012. Use the 10 most popular summer Olympics disciplines where _most popular_ you can define yourself.

One *requirement*: use [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to create a dataframe you can work on.

For the data visualization part, you can try [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) if you want to try a heatmap and different kind of visualizatios. You can install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)) to work in an interactive notebook.

### Don't be shy

Create a barplot which shows the total medals won for each sport during the summer Olympics. 

### Bonus

To take this even further you could create a map and choose colors for each Country, pointing out the ones which won most medals. To get started on this, you can try [plotly](https://plot.ly/) library, and specifically [Choropleth Maps in Python](https://plot.ly/python/choropleth-maps/).

## Ideas and feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues) or [reach out](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) directly.

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
