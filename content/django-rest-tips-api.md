Summary: In this article we are going to build a abstract our platform's Python tips into a RESTful service. First we make a simple Django app, defining the Tips model and create a Django command to import a JSON file of the ones we already have. Next we make an API with Django Rest Framework supporting common CRUD operations. We play with the new endpoints using Postman and write some tests using pytest. Then we deploy the app to Digital Ocean. Lastly we build a cool interface into this new API using Slash Commands, which lets our community submit tips directly from Slack's message box. Sounds exciting? You bet it is, so let's jump straight in!
