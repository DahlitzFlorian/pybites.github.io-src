Summary: Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python programming. You can use Python and all the libraries you need to analyze the data of Olympic Games and find out interesting things and present them to everyone with libraries such as matpolib

Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python programming. 

## The Challenge

### Basic

* Analyse statistics of Olympic Games in a CSV file that you can find on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games):

	* Find out the (male and female) athlete who won most medals in all the Summer Olympic Games (1896-2014)
	The answer will be Michael Phelps for the men and Larisa Latynina for the women
	* Display the first 10 countries that won most medals, respectively for men and women
	The order will be for men: USA, Russia (considering that before was URSS), UK,France, Italy, Sweden , Germany, Hungary, Australia, Japan
	The order will be for women: USA, Russia, China, Australia, Germany(it would be third if we sum the results with the German Democratic Republic), Netherlands, Romania, UK, Japan, Hungary
	* Use matplotlib to build line plots of the 10 most awarded countries in 1896-2014 span time for the 10 most popular summer Olympics disciplines (you can decide criteria for most popular)
	
	One requirement: use pandas to create a dataframe you can work on. https://pandas.pydata.org/  for the data visualization, you can try matplotlib library https://matplotlib.org/
	Seaborn might be used for data  visualization if you want to try to do heatmap and different visualizatios but it is not necessary

	(You can directly install Jupyter to work on a notebook environment)  

### Don't be shy

	* 	Create a barplot which shows the total medals won for each sport during the summer Olympics. 

### Bonus:

	* You can create a map and choose colors for each Country, pointing out the ones which won most medals
	  To get started on this, you can try plotly library. Here you can get started https://plot.ly/python/choropleth-maps/

### Feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues) or [reach out](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) directly.

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
